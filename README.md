<h1>Nmap project panel</h1>
I made this script for a school assignment. It is build in python (flask) and it uses a database to store the scan results and it uses a html front-end to display the information. 

<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>It is recommended to install the python dependencies in a separate virtual environment.
Use the requirements.txt file to install the dependencies:
<code>pip3 install -r requirements.txt</code></p>
<p>To start the script, just run the app.py file: <code>python3 app.py</code></p>

<h2>Future development</h2>
<p> - More Nmap settings (sC, O, etc.)<br>
    - A discovery panel to scan an IP range for online devices.</p>
